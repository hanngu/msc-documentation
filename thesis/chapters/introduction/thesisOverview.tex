%This section provides the reader with an overview of what is coming in the next
%chapters. You want to say more than what is explicit in the chapter name, if
%possible, but still keep the description short and to the point.

Chapter 2 sets the context for this thesis. It starts by discussing the domain swarm intelligence in Section \ref{sec:swarmIntelligence}, and includes theory about Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). In Section \ref{sec:VRP} the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is described, along with the Urban Transit Network Design Problem, which is a subproblem of the VRP. In Section \ref{sec:graphdb} graph theory is described and put in context with graph databases. The graph database ``Neo4j'' is also presented.
