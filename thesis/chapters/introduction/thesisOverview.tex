%This section provides the reader with an overview of what is coming in the next
%chapters. You want to say more than what is explicit in the chapter name, if
%possible, but still keep the description short and to the point.

Chapter 2 sets the context for this thesis. It starts by discussing the domain swarm intelligence in Section \ref{sec:swarmIntelligence}, and includes theory about ant colony optimization (ACO), bee colony optimization (BCO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). In Section \ref{sec:VRP} the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is described, along with the Urban Transit Network Design Problem, which is a subproblem of the VRP. Section \ref{sec:graphdb} is describes graph theory and puts it in context with graph databases. The graph database ``Neo4j'' is also presented. 

Chapter 3 describes the preparatory research done in order to develop the proposed method. Section \ref{sec:definingResearchTopic} defines the research topic used in order to guide the Structured Literature Review\citep{kofod2014}, which further is described in Section \ref{sec:structuredLiteratureReview}. Section \ref{sec:relatedWork} describes and discusses related work and will at the end answer \ref{itm:RQ1}. Finally, in Section \ref{subsec:problemStatement} the problem statement is proposed.  

Chapter 4 describes the implemented system in detail. It starts by an overall description of the system, followed by the chosen environment used to implement the system. Further, the assessments used in order to construct solutions by the system is explained. Section \ref{sec:algoInitialization} - \ref{sec:evaporation} is a detailed description of each step conducted by the system.
