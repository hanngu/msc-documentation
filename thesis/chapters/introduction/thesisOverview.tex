Chapter 2 sets the context for this thesis. It starts by discussing the domain swarm intelligence in Section \ref{sec:swarmIntelligence}, and includes theory about Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). In Section \ref{sec:VRP} the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is described, along with the Urban Transit Network Design Problem, which is a subproblem of the VRP. Section \ref{sec:graphdb} is describes graph theory and puts it in context with graph databases. The graph database ``Neo4j'' is also presented.

Chapter 3 describes the preparatory research done in order to develop the proposed method. Section \ref{sec:definingResearchTopic} defines the research topic used in order to guide the Structured Literature Review\citep{kofod2014}, which further is described in Section \ref{sec:structuredLiteratureReview}. Section \ref{sec:relatedWork} describes and discusses related work and will at the end answer \ref{itm:RQ1}. Finally, in Section \ref{subsec:problemStatement} the problem statement is proposed.
