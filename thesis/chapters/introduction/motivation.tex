AtB goes with deficit. AtB gÃ¥r med underskudd. 

A known problem is rush traffic (takes time to get to work, and not good for the environemt - global warming etc). To mimimize the rush traffic with making more
users take public transport, the users must be satisfied. Full busses makes users less satisfied. The passengers can allow to stand on the bus for a maximum of 15 minutes (AtB surveys). New lines has high costs and it takes time for these busses to fill up. 

We want to To satisfy more users and not increase the costs. ==> optimize. 

The current solution of AtB consist of an experience based route network. There has never been done any analysis and it has never been optimized. Optimalisering = nyhetsverdi.
