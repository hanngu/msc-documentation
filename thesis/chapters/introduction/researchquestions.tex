\section{Goals and Research Questions}

\textit{As a result of all of this, in this thesis, we would like to optimize the bus routes. Try to make it convenient for the passengers but also minimize fleet size? etc.}


\textbf{This is the main message to the readers}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Which AI methods is best suited for optimization?
  \item Which factors play the greatest role, regarding optimization?
  \item Does this solution help optimizing the bus routes? (Is this solution better than the existing solution)
   \ldots
\end{itemize}
