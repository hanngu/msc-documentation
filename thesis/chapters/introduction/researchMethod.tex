\section{Research Methods}

%What methodology will you apply to address the goals: theoretic/analytic, model/abstraction
%or design/experiment? This section will describe the research methodology applied
%and the reason for this choice of research methodology.

In order to answer \vref{itm:RQ1} a Structured Literature Review, as described by \citep{kofod2014}, is conducted. This is done to ensure that we are able to draw valid conclusions about what the state-of-the-art is. The results of the final synthesis is described in Related Work, and this is the basis for the problem statement.

The research method that is used in order to answer \vref{itm:RQ2} and \vref{itm:RQ3}, is designing the proposed system and conducting relevant experiments. 

In order to test whether or not the added attributes from other swarm intelligence algorithms is efficient, the performance of the proposed algorithm and generic ACO algorithm is compared. 

To establish how the proposed system performs compared to other methods described in literature, experiments solving a well-known benchmark problem with the proposed system is conducted. 

In order to test if the proposed system is applicable for optimizing the transit routes in large urban cities, the proposed system will be tested with larger networks as input. 

For all the experiments, numeric values of the established performance criteria will be presented. This values will be used to discuss the performance of the proposed system.
