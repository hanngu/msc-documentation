\section{Goals and Research Questions}

\textbf{Goal:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Increase the number of public transportation passengers by making urban transit routes and schedules more efficient.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Research Questions:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Is swarm intelligence methods suitable for the vehicle routing problem (VRP) ?
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the state-of-the-art of solving vehicle routing problems using swarm intelligence methods?
    \item What changes have been done to the classical swarm intelligence-methods to improve them?
    \item Have there been done any attempts to combine different swarm intelligence-methods?
  \end{enumerate}

Through our review of research, we note that no researchers have focused on the aim to combine attributes from different swarm intelligence methods to improve the optimization process. Hence, the research question:

\item Is it efficient to combine attributes from different swarm intelligence-methods to ``solve'' the vehicle routing problem?
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item If so, is it possible to apply the algorithm to the urban transit networks to cities like Trondheim?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
