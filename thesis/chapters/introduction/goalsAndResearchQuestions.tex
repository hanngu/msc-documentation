\textbf{Goal:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \label{itm:goal} Increase the number of public transportation passengers by making urban transit routes and schedules more efficient.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Research Questions:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Is swarm intelligence methods suitable for the vehicle routing problem (VRP) ?
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the state-of-the-art of solving vehicle routing problems using swarm intelligence methods?
    \item What changes have been done to the classical swarm intelligence-methods to improve them?
    \item Have there been done any attempts to combine different swarm intelligence-methods?
  \end{enumerate}
 
\item Is it efficient to combine attributes from different swarm intelligence-methods to optimize bus routes?
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item If so, is it possible to apply the algorithm to the urban transit networks to cities like Trondheim?
  \end{enumerate}
  %TODO: Skrive om disse litt:
\item What are the possibilities and potential advantages of graph databases for optimizing transportation networks?
\begin{enumerate}
\item It is effective to use the features of graph databases for the optimization process? 
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
