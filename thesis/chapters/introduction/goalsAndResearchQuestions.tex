\section{Goals and Research Questions}

Near all of the existing solutions to the VRP are heuristics and metaheuristics because no exact algorithm can be guaranteed to find optimal tours with reasonable computing time when the number of cities is large. This is due to the NP-Hardness of the problem.

\textbf{The main objective of this thesis is therefore to ... }
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{This is the main message to the readers..........}
  \item Which AI methods is best suited for optimization?
  \item Which factors play the greatest role, regarding optimization?
  \item Does this solution help optimizing the bus routes? (Is this solution better than the existing solution)
   \ldots
\end{enumerate}
