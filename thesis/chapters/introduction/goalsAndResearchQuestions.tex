\textbf{Goal:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \label{itm:goal} Increase the number of public transportation passengers by making urban transit routes and schedules more efficient.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Research Questions:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Is swarm intelligence methods suitable for the vehicle routing problem?
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the state-of-the-art in solving vehicle routing problems using swarm intelligence methods?
    \item What changes have been done to the classical swarm intelligence-methods to improve them?
    \item Have there been any attempts to combine different swarm intelligence-methods?
  \end{enumerate}
 
\item Is it efficient to combine attributes from different swarm intelligence-methods to optimize bus routes?
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item If so, is it possible to apply the algorithm to the urban transit networks to cities like Trondheim?
  \end{enumerate}

\item What are the possibilities and potential advantages of using a graph database in our implementation?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Is the features of graph databases useful in the optimization process? 
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
