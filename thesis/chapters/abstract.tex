%The abstract is your sales pitch which encourages people to read your work but unlike sales it should be realistic with respect to the contributions of the work. It should include:
\begin{itemize}
\item the field of research
\item a brief motivation for the work
\item what the research topic is and
\item the research approach(es) applied. 
\item contributions
\end{itemize}

The abstract length should be roughly half a page of text --- without lists, tables or figures.
