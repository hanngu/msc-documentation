Social insect colonies, such as ant or bee colonies, have shown that simple organisms can perform complex tasks by interacting with each other. These colonies are highly distributed and self-organized, and they adapts well to changes in the environment. Swarm intelligence \citep{swarmintelligence} is a branch of artificial intelligence that tries to adapt the characteristics of these social insects in intelligent computer systems. Swarm intelligence-methods have proven to optimize highly complex optimization problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
