\section{ACM Digital Library}
\textbf{Notes:} ACM Digital Library did not support a mix of ANDs and ORs in its initial input field, but this was possible in advanced search. The search string was not modified, and the first search gave a satisfactory number of results.

\textbf{Queries:}
\begin{itemize}
\item (Train OR plane OR bus OR delivery) AND (``path optimization'' OR ``scheduling optimization'' OR ``route optimization'' OR planning OR multimodal) AND (``bee colony optimization'' OR ``particle swarm optimization'' OR ``swarm intelligence'' OR ``ant colony optimization'' OR bco OR pso OR aco) AND (transit OR transportation OR traffic OR vehicle) AND (``artificial intelligence'' OR ai OR ``machine learning'') AND ``multi agent'' AND routing

\section{ScienceDirect}
\textbf{Notes:} In ScienceDirect it was only possible to perform a full text search. The first search was within ``all sciences'' and this retrieved 100 results. The next search was therefore just within ``Computer Science'', which gave less, but a lot more relevant papers. In addition to this books were excluded from the results.

\section{CiteSeer}
\textbf{Notes:} In CiteSeer you cannot perform a search within title, abstract and keywords at the same time. It was therefore conducted a full text search by adding the element text:() to the query.  Some of the retrieved papers had an unknown title with unknown authors, so theese were excluded from the results. The complete search string gave 27 results.

\textbf{Queries:}
\begin{itemize}
\item text:((Train OR plane OR bus OR delivery) AND (``path optimization'' OR ``scheduling optimization'' OR ``route optimization'' OR planning OR multimodal) AND (``bee colony optimization'' OR ``particle swarm optimization'' OR ``swarm intelligence'' OR ``ant colony optimization'' OR bco OR pso OR aco) AND (transit OR transportation OR traffic OR vehicle) AND (``artificial intelligence'' OR ai OR ``machine learning'') AND ``multi agent'' AND routing)

\section{SpringerLink}
\textbf{Notes:} In SpringerLinks advanced search it was only possible to find articles with either all the words, the exact phrase or at least one of the words in the search string. For this reason the whole boolean search string was used in the initial input field. The first search gave 200 results, so the next search was only conducted within ``computer science'' and ``engineering''. In addition to this results within ``book chapters'' were removed.

\section{IEEE Xplore}
\par \textbf{Notes:} The search is done in full text, including metadata. The search string had to be changed to fulfill IEEE's criteria that the string only should contain 15 search terms.

\section{ISI Web of Knowledge}
\par \textbf{Notes:} In Web of Knowledge you cannot perform at full text search, and must choose to search in ``Topic'', ``Title'', ``Author'', ``Author Identifiers'', ``Editor'', ``Group Author'', ``Publication Name'', ``DOI'' or ``Year Published''. We decided to use ``Topic'', ``Title'' and ``Publication Name'' because it seemed the most relevant to our search terms. The search was done in ``All databases'', but only in the ``COMPUTER SCIENCE'' research area. The original search string (see table \ref{table:searchterms}) had to be modified, because it gave no results in Web Of Knowledge. A few terms were therefor excluded, and a few AND's were switched with OR's.

\section{Google Scholar}
\par \textbf{Notes:} Google Scholar only allows very short search strings, and we were therefor forced to split the query into smaller pieces and do mulitple search, for so to add the results togheter. The original search string had to be modified for making the splitting tolerable and effective.
