\section{ISI Web of Knowledge}
\par \textbf{Notes:} In Web of Knowledge you cannot perform at full text search, and must choose to search in ``Topic'', ``Title'', ``Author'', ``Author Identifiers'', ``Editor'', ``Group Author'', ``Publication Name'', ``DOI'' or ``Year Published''. We decided to use ``Topic'', ``Title'' and ``Publication Name'' because it seemed the most relevant to our search terms. The search was done in ``All databases'', but only in the ``COMPUTER SCIENCE'' research area. The original search string (see table [TODO: insert reference to table]) had to be modified, because it gave no results in Web Of Knowledge. A few terms were therefor excluded, and a few AND's were switched with OR's.
