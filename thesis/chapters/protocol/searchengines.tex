\section{IEEE Xplore}

\textbf{Search strings used:}
\begin{itemize}
\item String 1:
\begin{itemize}
\item (train OR plane OR bus OR delivery) AND (``path optimization'' OR ``scheduling optimization'' OR ``route optimization'') AND (bee colony optimization OR ``particle swarm optimization'' OR ``swarm intelligence'' OR ``ant colony optimization'') AND (transit OR transportation OR traffic OR vehicle) AND (``artificial intelligence'' OR ai) AND (``multi agent'') AND (``graph database'' OR neo4j)
\item Number of results: 0
\item Date of search: 29.10.2014
\end{itemize}
\item String 2 (without neo4j and graph database, including multi angent):
\begin{itemize}
\item (train OR plane OR bus OR delivery) AND (``path optimization'' OR ``scheduling optimization'' OR ``route optimization'') AND (``bee colony optimization'' OR ``particle swarm optimization'' OR ``swarm intelligence'' OR ``ant colony optimization'') AND (transit OR transportation OR traffic OR vehicle) AND (``artificial intelligence'' OR ai) AND (``multi agent'') 
\item Number of results: 56
\item Date of search: 29.10.2014
\end{itemize}
\item String 3 (removed the different vehicle terms and multi agent):
\begin{itemize}
\item (``path optimization'' OR ``scheduling optimization'' OR ``route optimization'') AND (``bee colony optimization'' OR ``particle swarm optimization'' OR ``swarm intelligence'' OR ``ant colony optimization'') AND (transit OR transportation OR traffic OR vehicle) AND (``artificial intelligence'' OR ai) 
\item Number of results: 166
\item Date of search: 29.10.2014
\end{itemize}
\item String 4 (added abbreviations of the algorithms):
\begin{itemize}
\item (``path optimization'' OR ``scheduling optimization'' OR ``route optimization'') AND (``bee colony optimization'' OR ``particle swarm optimization'' OR ``swarm intelligence'' OR ``ant colony optimization'' OR pso OR aso OR bso) AND (transit OR transportation OR traffic OR vehicle) AND (``artificial intelligence'' OR ai) 
\item Number of results: 178
\item Date of search: 29.10.2014
\end{itemize}
\item String 5 (swithched the first AND with an OR):
\begin{itemize}
\item((``path optimization'' OR ``scheduling optimization'' OR ``route optimization'') OR (transit OR transportation OR traffic OR vehicle)) AND (``bee colony optimization'' OR ``particle swarm optimization'' OR ``swarm intelligence'' OR ``ant colony optimization'' OR pso OR bso OR aso)  AND ("artificial intelligence" OR ai)
\item Number of results: 4300
\item Date of search: 29.10.2014
\end{itemize}
\item String 6 (switched the OR back to AND. Removed artificial intelligence and ai):
\begin{itemize}
\item(``path optimization'' OR ``scheduling optimization'' OR ``route optimization'') AND (``bee colony optimization'' OR ``particle swarm optimization'' OR ``swarm intelligence'' OR ``ant colony optimization'' OR pso OR bso OR aco) 
\item Number of results: 687
\item Date of search: 29.10.2014
\end{itemize}
\item String 7 (good number of results, but we want to inlude transportation, vechicle, train, plane, bus and delivery because it is an important part of what we are looking for):
\begin{itemize}
\item(``path optimization'' OR ``scheduling optimization'' OR ``route optimization'') AND (transit OR traffic OR transportation OR vehicle OR train OR plane OR bus OR delivery) AND (``bee colony optimization'' OR ``particle swarm optimization'' OR ``swarm intelligence'' OR ``ant colony optimization'' OR pso OR bso OR aco) 
\item Number of results: 508
\item Date of search: 29.10.2014
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Search strings used:}
\begin{itemize}
\item String 1 (the same string that gave the best result in IEEE Xplore): 
\begin{itemize}
\item (``path optimization'' OR ``scheduling optimization'' OR ``route optimization'') AND (transit OR traffic OR transportation OR vehicle OR train OR plane OR bus OR delivery) AND (``bee colony optimization'' OR ``particle swarm optimization'' OR ``swarm intelligence'' OR ``ant colony optimization'' OR pso OR bso OR aco) 
\item Number of results: 31
\item Date of search: 29.10.2011
\end{itemize}
\item String 2 (switched the first AND with an OR to get a more general result): 
\begin{itemize}
\item (( ``path optimization'' OR ``scheduling optimization'' OR ``route optimization'' OR transit OR traffic OR transportation OR vehicle OR train OR plane OR bus OR delivery) AND (``bee colony optimization'' OR ``particle swarm optimization'' OR ``swarm intelligence'' OR ``ant colony optimization'' OR pso OR bso OR aco))
\item Number of results: 1,294
\item Date of search: 29.10.2011
\end{itemize}
\item String 3 (removed some less relevant word, such as schduling optimization, transit and plane): 
\begin{itemize}
\item ((``path optimization'' OR ``route optimization'' OR transportation OR vehicle OR bus ) AND (``bee colony optimization'' OR ``particle swarm optimization'' OR ``swarm intelligence'' OR ``ant colony optimization'' OR pso OR bso OR aco))
\item Number of results: 622
\item Date of search: 29.10.2011
\end{itemize}
\item String 4 (in addition a search was done were we added the terms ``neo4j'' and ``graph database'' for the search string that originial gave the most results. Non of the found papers were relevant): 
\begin{itemize}
\item (( ``path optimization'' OR ``scheduling optimization'' OR ``route optimization'' OR transit OR traffic OR transportation OR vehicle OR train OR plane OR bus OR delivery) AND (``bee colony optimization'' OR ``particle swarm optimization'' OR ``swarm intelligence'' OR ``ant colony optimization'' OR pso OR bso OR aco) AND (neo4j OR ``graph database''))
