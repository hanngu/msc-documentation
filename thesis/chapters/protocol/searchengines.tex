%Web of Knowledge
\section{Web of Knowledge}
In Web of Knowledge you cannot perform at full text search, and must choose to search in “Topic”, “Title”, “Author”, “Author Identifiers”, “Editor”, “Group Author”, “Publication Name”, “DOI” or “Year Published”. We decided to use “Topic”, “Title” and “Publication Name” because the seemed most relevant to our search terms. Non of our search terms gave any results when we searched for “Publication Name”. Only some of the search terms gave results when we searcher for “Title”. The fifth result is considered the best, and in this search we used the exact same search terms as in the forth search, but we chose to only search in articles from the research area “Computer Science”. 
\newline
\textbf{Search strings used:}
\begin{itemize}
\item String 1 (Used the best result from SpringerLink, but this gave too little results)

When we searched for the exact same terms, but chose articles just from the research area “computer science” the results was much better.

%IEEExplore
\section{IEEE Xplore}
IEEE Xplore allows the option to search for either full text or metadata only. After reviewing the results, we see tat the retrieved papers from full text includes alot more than just research papers, e.g conference proceedings. When searching for metadata only instead (which searches within abstract, title and indexing terms), the results become more relevant. IEEE Xplore allows a maximum of 15 search terms, so we had to be selective with the terms and therefore only include the terms we think is the most relevant for out thesis. In addition, IEEE Xplore only retrieve papers from 2000 to 2014.
