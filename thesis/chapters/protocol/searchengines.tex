\textbf{Search strings used:}
\begin{itemize}
\item String 1:
\begin{itemize}
\item (train OR plane OR bus OR delivery) AND (path optimization OR scheduling optimization OR route optimization) AND (bee colony optimization OR particle swarm optimization OR swarm intelligence OR ant colony optimization) AND (transit OR transportation OR traffic OR vehicle) AND (artificial intelligence OR ai) AND (multi-agent) AND ("graph database" OR neo4j)
\item Number of results: 1
