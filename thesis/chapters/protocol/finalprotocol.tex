\section{Research Questions}
To conduct a structured literature review it is vital to decide the problem to be solved, referred to as P, and the constraints used to guide the search, referred to as C.
\newline

One of the goals for the environment package for transportation in Trondheim, ``Miljøpakken'', is to provide better public transport. There has never been done any optimization of the bus routes in Trondheim, the existing solution is based on experience. The problem formulation for this thesis was therefore based on the idea to improve todays solution by optimizing the bus routes using AI-methods. (And as a result of this satisfy the same amount of users today with less resources.)

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{P:} Optimizing the bus routes in Trondheim using AI-methods.
\item \textbf{C:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Swarm intelligence. \textit{TODO: Motivation behind swarm intelligence?}
        \item Neo4J?
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{This gives us the following research questions:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item What are the existing solutions to this problem?
\item Which AI methods is best suited for optimizing? 
\item Which of the selected AI-methods is best suited?
\item Does this solution help optimize the bus routes? 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Scoring Criteria}
\textit{Helptext: The purpose of this step is to filter away studies that are not thematically relevant to the area chosen. THe protocol should define exactly which inclusion (IC) and Quality criteria (QC) are employed}
