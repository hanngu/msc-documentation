\subsection{Evaluating Method Implementation}

All components.. are tested for correctness. All individual components are individually tested before joined..


%1. How demonstrative is the program?
%(a) Can we evaluate its external behavior?
%(b) How transparent is it? Can we evaluate internal behavior?
Neo4j er ikke s√• lett i evaluere.
%(c) Can the class of capabilities necessary for the task be demonstrated by a well-defined set of test cases?
%(d) How many test cases does it demonstrate?

%2. Is it specially tuned for a particular example?

YES! Mandl Network with 4 routes.

%3. How well does the program implement the method?
%(a) Can you determine the program's limitations?
%(b) Have parts been left out or kludged? Why and to what effect?
%(c) Has implementation forced a detailed definition or even reevaluation of the method? How was this reevaluation %accomplished?

%4. Is the program's performance predictable?
