\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
%Discuss what you managed, and why you had sucess / not success. Show that you understand. In the discussion it is important to include a discussion of not just the merits of the work conducted but also the limitations.
%Svar på research questionsene. %Hva har vi fått til? Hva har vi ikke fått til? Hvorfor fikk vi det til? Hvorfor fikk vi det ikke til? (Små endringer som faktisk kunne blitt gjort, må ikke nevnes, betyr bare at vi har begynt sent på oppgaven.)
%Evaluation is an issue discussed a lot in the field of artificial intelligence. Where other sciences has specific aspects of research to be presented, empirical AI does not have such comparable standards. In this effort, \citet{cohen88} introduced a five-stage model for evaluating AI systems. Initiated in Section \vref{sec:structuredLiteratureReview}, this model is used for evaluating the proposed method and this thesis as a whole.
