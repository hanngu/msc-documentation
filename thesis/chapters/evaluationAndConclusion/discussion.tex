The parameters tested and used are specifically tuned for Mandl's Transit Network containing 4 routes, with maximum 8 nodes in one route, but the same parameters are used when testing with 6, 7, and 8 routes as well. This may be considered a weakness, because metaherustic methods, such as the one proposed in this thesis, requires calibration of parameters with respect to the problem at hand \citep{dobslaw09}.

The proposed method requires input on a particular form. Both nodes and their coordinates, travel time between nodes and the demand between nodes needs to be provided on a particular form in an .txt-document. This may be considered as a weakness of the method, but implementing support for retrieving the mentioned data on another form are considered as fairly easy.
