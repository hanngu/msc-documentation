\section{Discussion}

Discuss what you managed, and why you had sucess / not success. 
Show that you understand.

In the discussion it is important to include a discussion of not just the merits of the work conducted but also the limitations. 

The parameters $s$ and $i$ are probably connected --> Det har ikke vi tatt hensyn til.
