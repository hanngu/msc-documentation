%What are the main contributions made to the field and how significant are these contribution.

In this thesis, we have demonstrated that the performance of a generic ant colony optimization algorithm improves when adding additional attributes inspired by other swarm intelligence-methods. The proposed method creates effective urban transit routes on Mandl's network\citep{mandl79}, and shows especially promising results concerning the average travel time.
