In this thesis, we proposed a system for the urban transit routing problem. The proposed SuperSwarm optimization system creates optimal urban transit routes on Mandl's network\citep{mandl79}, and shows especially promising results concerning the average travel time per transit user. We have demonstrated that the performance of a generic ant colony optimization algorithm improves when adding additional attributes inspired by other swarm intelligence-methods. %siste setning på omformuleres


%The system developed is based on  Swarm Intelligence methods. We showed that adding additional attributes to a classic Ant colony optimization method clearly[hardt å melde?] improved the performance. The proposed SuperSwarm optimization system
