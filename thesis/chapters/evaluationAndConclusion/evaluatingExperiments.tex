\subsection{Evaluating What Experiments Told Us}
\subsubsection{Parameter Settings}

Metaheuristics, like ACO, requires a good initial parameter setting to solve concrete problems optimally. As mentioned in the 

\emph{\color{blue} TODO:}
Punkter vi må huske på:
\begin{itemize}
\item The parameter settings will be optimized for the Mandl network with 4 routes?
\item 0\% crazy ants gave worse results than both 5\% and 10\% CA: some crazy ants is better than none. But, as we see in the results, more than 10\% CA gives worse results than 0\% CA, \emph{\color{blue} it does not mean the more crazy ants, the better results regarding the final results. But some CA is good.}
\end{itemize}
