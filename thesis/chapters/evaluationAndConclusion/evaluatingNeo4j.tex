\subsection{Evaluating Neo4J}

%Remember:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Advantages: built-in-method for finding shortest path.
%\item We used A* first, which we also tested and showed that it was a lot more faster than Dijkstra's. But the implementation of A* could not find all paths, only one, so we had to use Dijkstra's for the evaluation.. Disadvantage of using the Neo4j package? Maybe easier to have made our own implementation?
%\end{itemize}

\textbf{What are the advantages of Neo4j in our implementation?}

\textbf{What are the limitations?}
When does it break? - When the amount of nodes is too high it breaks

\textbf{Do you understand why it work and doesn't work?}
It breaks when Neo4j exceed its Id capacity.

\textbf{Does the implementation of Neo4j differ from our predictions?}
