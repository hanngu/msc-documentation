\subsection{Evaluating Scalability Results}

\textbf{How did the program performance compare to its selected standard?}
What is the selected standard for this? What are we comparing against?

\textbf{Did the program demonstrate good performance?}

\textbf{Is the programs performance different from predictions?}

\textbf{How efficient is the program?}

\textbf{Can you define the programs limitations?}
When does it break, and what components contributes to its successful operations?

\textbf{Did you learn what you wanted from the programs experiments?}

\textbf{Do you understand why it works / doesn't work?}
