\section{Evaluation}

When evaluating your results, avoid drawing grand conclusions, beyond that which your results can in fact support. Further, although you may have designed your experiments to answer certain questions, the results may raise other questions in the eyes of the reader. It is important that you study the graphs/tables to look for unusual features/entries and discuss these as well as discussing the main findings in the results. 

\subsection{Parameter Settings}
Remember:
\begin{itemize}
\item $p_v$, $p_b$: giving these values a higher number, results in awarding the local best ants edges by giving them more pheromone, which we observed gave worse results, \emph{\color{red}because get stuck at local optima? blabla}
\item with 100\% crazy ants, the ants did not manage to find a solution \emph{\color{red}because...}. 
\item 0\% crazy ants gave worse results than both 5\% and 10\% CA, where we can conclude that some crazy ants is better than none. But, as we see in the results, more than 10\% CA gives worse results than 0\% CA, so we can conclude that it does not mean the more crazy ants, the better results regarding the final results. But some CA is good for the colony:)
\item Our start values - 10\% on $p_e$, $BR$, $FA$, and $CA$, was actually the best values all along. We could have set these to have worse values in the beginning of the test experiment, and receiving increasing results concerning $TOTFIT$ and $ATT$, but \emph{\color{red} we set the start values to be what we though was best, because???, and with this conclude that our instinct regarding these values was the best.}
\item 100\% and 50\% FA was better than having 0\% following ants; can we conclude that it is better to have following ants, than not have following ants ?
\item Ant colony size ,$s$, parameter testing will be optimized for Mandl network only.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Neo4j}

Whether Neo4J is suited. Advantages / disadvantages of using a graph database in our implementation (research question 3a)
