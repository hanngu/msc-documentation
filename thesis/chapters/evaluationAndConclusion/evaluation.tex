\section{Evaluation}

%When evaluating your results, avoid drawing grand conclusions, beyond that which your results can in fact support. Further, although you may have designed your experiments to answer certain questions, the results may raise other questions in the eyes of the reader. It is important that you study the graphs/tables to look for unusual features/entries and discuss these as well as discussing the main findings in the results. 



%where the first stage involves refining the research topic to a task, and identifying a view of how to accomplish the task. 



%\subsection{Neo4j}

%\emph{\color{blue} TODO:}

%Whether Neo4J is suited. Advantages / disadvantages of using a graph database in our implementation (research question 3a)

%Remember:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Advantages: built-in-method for finding shortest path.
%\item We used A* first, which we also tested and showed that it was a lot more faster than Dijkstra's. But the implementation of A* could not find all paths, only one, so we had to use Dijkstra's for the evaluation.. Disadvantage of using the Neo4j package? Maybe easier to have made our own implementation?
%\end{itemize}
