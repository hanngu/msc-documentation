\section{Evaluation}

When evaluating your results, avoid drawing grand conclusions, beyond that which your results can in fact support. Further, although you may have designed your experiments to answer certain questions, the results may raise other questions in the eyes of the reader. It is important that you study the graphs/tables to look for unusual features/entries and discuss these as well as discussing the main findings in the results.
