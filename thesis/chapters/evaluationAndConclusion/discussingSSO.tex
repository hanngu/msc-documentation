\item[\textbf{(2) a)}] Does adding attributes from other swarm intelligence-methods improve the performance of the standard ant colony optimization algorithm?
\end{itemize}

First of all, it is important to acknowledge that the classic ACO has many advantages in solving VRPs. Solving certain types of NP-hard problems in polynomial time, and being optimal given there is no absolutely correct solution are some of these advantages. \citet{hsiao04} showed that a classic ACO algorithm performed better than a brute method. Before any distinct pheromone trail is laid, the ant's choices are more random and thus they perform a broad search in the environment. This randomness will decrease over time as the pheromone trails become more distinct. Because pheromone evaporate over time, shorter paths will be favored over longer paths simply because shortest paths takes shorter time. This approach is good enough when the problem to be solved is to be optimal. However, for the UTRP problem, the problem to be solved is the attempt of finding the best possible solution. In ACO the short paths will be excessively attractive to the following ones, which may result in obtaining a local optima. In the UTRP there are many factors for determining a good solution. As mentioned, a good route set is the one with the best results concerning the performance criteria. The evaluation of the route set as a whole is done after each iteration, and this evaluation will determine how good the produced route set is. Because standard ACO doesn't have a function of rewarding the best route sets, there will be no possibility to ``inform'' the ants if they are converging towards a local optimum. To overcome these weaknesses of ACO and to boost the algorithms performance, attributes inspired by other approaches within swarm intelligence methods was added the proposed algorithm. %Thus, when one ant finds a good (i.e., short) path from the colony to a food source, other ants are more likely to follow that path, and positive feedback eventually leads to all the ants' following a single path.

\citet{salehi-nezhad07}, \citet{tripathi09}, and \citet{sedighpour14} all showed that rewarding the best solutions found so far improved the algorithm. Rewarding the best solution may be seen as the similar recruit function of the bee colony optimization (BCO). In BSO the artificial bee which has produced a good route set it can ``recruit'' other nest-mates, and thus inform the others that a good route set is found. This process inspired to add the ``following'' feature to the proposed method. After the route sets are evaluated, an amount of the best ants with the best route sets is selected to be followed in the next iteration. The same amount of ants will follow the same routes as the one they are following, and thus create the exact same route set. This will give the edges in the best route sets more pheromone, and thus distinct edges with much pheromone (because they are walked by many ants, given the short path) from edges that are better concerning the performance criteria. The proposed algorithm's performance was improved with this additional attribute. However, the algorithm performed best with a relatively small amount of followers, but with a large amount of pheromone.  Rewarding edges in a large amount best route sets will result in over appreciating too many edges, which again will unable to distinct edges in good route sets from edges in the best route sets.  %By making ants follow new best routes after each iteration will also give a variation of the best produced route sets, and thus avoid over rewarding edges in a local optima. 

\citet{kechagiopoulos14} used a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm which proved to perform better than all solutions compared to. In PSO, like ACO, the particles tend to explore more in the the early iterations of the algorithm, and becoming more organized and coordinated at the late iterations. In PSO, this is due to a parameter called Inertia Weight. The parameter is added to balance the local and global search, preventing the particles from drastically changing directions. However, the best global known solution the particles are drawn against may, similar to ACO, be a (possible) local optimum. An attribute called ``crazy ants'' is added to the proposed method, where an amount of the colony is given the possibility to explore edges completely random, and will not be influenced by the best known solutions. This additional feature improved the performance of the proposed algorithm. This may be due to the fact that the attribute enables an amount of ants to explore undetected better solutions when pheromone trails becomes too great. The Inertia Weight parameter, inspired from PSO, denotes the amount of crazy ants in the beginning of each run, and the amount of ``crazy ants'' decrease in line with the parameter. Decreasing the inertia weight in PSO may suffer from low global search ability at the end of the run, and thus the possibly of getting stuck at a local optima. However, in the proposed method the ``crazy ants'' are not searching towards the best known solution, and will thus prevent the same disadvantage. 

We can not unambiguously conclude that the additional attributes inspired by BCO and / or PSO is the only reason the performance of ACO improved. Giving the ants memory, inspired by \citet{dorigo96}, has previously proven to be effective concerning the performance of ACO. \citet{sedighpour14}, \citet{poorzahedy11} \citet{salehinejad10} also gave the ant's similar features, by maintaining a list of the nodes that were visited, in order to avoid cycles. This function was also added to the proposed algorithm. And as we saw in Section \vref{subsec:evaluating_PerfomanceComparison}, the proposed algorithm performed better already in the first iteration because of the larger amount of produced route sets.

\begin{itemize}
\item[\textbf{(2) b)}] How does the proposed method perform compared to methods published in literature?
%\item[\textbf{(2) b?)}] Does the proposed method demonstrate good performance?
\end{itemize}

The proposed method produce the best average travel time compared to all route sets sizes published in the literature. Concerning the unsatisfied passengers criteria, there are no passengers needing to transfer more than twice in the best produced route set, which is equal to all approaches published in the literature. For the rest of the performance criteria concerning the number of direct travelers, one transfers, and two transfers, the algorithm performs below average compared to the other approaches. This is due to a user-defined parameter sat to favor a small travel time over a high amount of direct transfers, based on the ration between the two. Again, it is worth mentioning that a direct route is still an important factor when evaluating the best route set. This reflects that the number of direct travelers in the best produced route set is still relatively high.

As mentioned in the motivation, citizens often prefer private transportation because of the decreased travel time when no detours is needed. Then again, another important issue concerning passenger satisfiability, is the issue of not needing to change vehicles during a trip. Whether a passenger would travel travel direct with a larger travel time versus transferring and thus decrease the travel time, is a matter of preferences. As you can see in all the approaches published in the literature including the proposed algorithm, you will have to choose one at the expense of the other. One can argue back and forth on the importance of each criteria. We believe that in the modern urban city, a minimum travel time is an important factor. People should have a small travel time as an option if time is limited. As mentioned, the produced route network also possess a relatively high amount of direct routes, giving passengers opportunities to choose direct routes if this is desired. %And reflecting the average travel time of the best route set produced by the proposed algorithm, the direct travels are not very long. %jeg er litt usikker på om jeg er på villspor her
When all comes to all, it is eventually up to each individual passenger choosing what is most convenient for them.
