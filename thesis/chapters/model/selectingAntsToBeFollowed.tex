\section{Selecting Ants to be Followed}
\label{sec:selctingAntsToBeFollowed}

After the $TOTFIT(r)$ value of each ant is calculated, the ants are added to a list sorted in descending order, where the ant with the best $TOTFIT(r)$ value is placed in the first position. As initiated in Section \vref{sec:algoGeneratingSuperSwarm}, a percentage of the colony becomes followers, and follows the same path as one of the best ants from the previous iteration. To determine the number of ants to be followed for the next iterations, a value $NAF$, is calculated:

$$NAF = ants_{size} * AF$$
 
where $ants_{size}$ is the number of ants that satisfied all constraints, described in Section \vref{sec:algoRemoval}. The value of $AF$ is selected after excessive testing described in \vref{sec:parametersettings}. Because the list is sorted with respect to the $TOTFIT(r)$ value, the $NAF$ first ants in the list will be the $NAF$ best ants, and these will get a follower in the next iteration.
