\section{Selecting ants to be followed}
\label{sec:selctingAntsToBeFollowed}

After the $TOTFIT(r)$ value of each ant is calculated, the ants are added to a list sorted in descending order. The ant with the best $TOTFIT(r)$ value is placed in the first position and so on. As initiated in Section \vref{sec:algoGeneratingSuperSwarm}, a percentage of the colony becomes followers and follows the same path as one of the best ants from the previous iteration. To determine the number of ants to be followed for the next iterations, a value $NAF$, is calculated:

$$NAF = ants_{size} * AF$$
 
where $ants_{size}$ is the number of ants that satisfied all constraints, described in Section \vref{sec:algoRemoval}. The value of $AF$ is selected after excessive testing described in \vref{sec:parametersettings}. Because the list is sorted with respect to the $TOTFIT(r)$ value, the $NAF$ first ants in the list will be the $NAF$ best ants. The $NAF$ first ants will, therefore, get a follower in the next iteration.
