\section{Development Environment}

The proposed system is implemented using the Java programming language. Java is one of the most used programming languages worldwide, and the possibility of further contributions is therefore enhanced by using Java. An additional benefit is that Neo4j offers a rich set of integration possibilities for Java wich also are well documented. Nevertheless, compared to languages like C++, Java is often considered slow and memory-intensive \citep{alnaser12}. However, \citet{sestoft10} states that managed languages like Java are easier and safer to use than traditional languages like C++. \citet{sestoft10} concludes, based on his conducted experiments, that ``there is no obvious relation between the execution speeds of different software platforms, even for the very simple programs studied here: the C, C\#, and Java platforms are variously fastest and slowest''.

An embedded version of the Neo4j database is used to represent the network including nodes, edges and the created routes. An embedded database in preferred to lower the latency of the many reads and writes executed when running the algorithm compared to a stand-alone version. 

To handle project dependencies, such as Neo4j, and configuration details, such as how much memory that is allocated to the program, Apache Maven\citep{website:maven} is used. Maven is a tool that can be used for building and managing any Java-based project.
