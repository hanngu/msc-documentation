\section{Generating SuperSwarm Colony}
\label{sec:algoGeneratingSuperSwarm}
After the initialization of the network, a SuperSwarm colony is generated. Because the basis of the algorithm is ACO, will the individuals of the SuperSwarm colony be referred to as ants. A colony consists of three types of individuals:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Normal Ants} - these ants chooses next nodes based on probability of each of the possible edges. 
\item \textit{Following Ants} - a number $n$ of the colony becomes Following Ants, $FA$. $n$ is determined by the $AF$ percentage of ants to be followed from the previous iteration. A Following Ant follows one of the best ants, $ba_i$, from the previous iteration unconditionally by choosing exactly the same path as $ba_i$ did.
\item \textit{Crazy Ants} - by a given probability a normal ant is declared ``crazy''. A crazy ant, $CA$, chooses next node at random, given the possible edges connected to the current node.  
\end{itemize}

How the individual ants generates routes is reviewed in Section \vref{sec:selectingNextNode}.
