\section{Algorithm Assessments}

\subsection{Constraints}
\label{sec:algoConstraints}
Some real world constraints should be satisfied:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{itm:constraintCycles} No cycles (or backtracks) in the graph is allowed. I.e. a node visited once in a route should not be visited again in the same route. 
\item \label{itm:constraintRouteSize} The route size is predefined. The algorithm / routes shall not exceed the minimum or maximum limit of nodes.
\item \label{itm:constraintRouteSetSize} The route set size is predefined. When ant $a$ reaches the number of allowed routes, $a$ is finished and ready for evaluation. This constraint is usually sat by the service provided due to cost limitations.
\item \label{itm:criteriaConnectedGraph} It must be a connected graph, because a passenger should be able to travel between any two nodes in the route network.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Evaluation Criteria} 
The aim of designing a route network is to optimize specific criteria that define its efficiency and quality. This evaluation is done during the execution of the algorithm and is based on the following evaluation criteria:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{itm:criteriaTotalTravelTime} Total travel time, referred to as $F_1(r)$.
\item \label{itm:f2} Number of transfers, referred to as $F_2(r)$.
\item Number of unsatisfied customers, referred to as $F_3(r)$. 
\end{enumerate}
These evaluation criteria are used to calculate the total fit of route set $r$. This process is explained in Section \vref{sec:totfit}.
%(The nodes with high demand should have higher priority for direct routes.)
