\section{SuperSwarm Optimization}

The baseline of the proposed algorithm, SuperSwarm Optimization (SSO), is an implementation of the ACO algorithm introduced by \citet{nanda11}, described in chapter \vref{backgroundAndMotivation}. External to the basic ACO, will the generated ants be given ``memory'', inspired by [ref], to recall whether a node is visited in an earlier route within the same route set. As initiated in Section \vref{sec:problemStatement}, are the ants also given some acknowledged features inspired by PSO and BCO, aiming to overcome some of ACO's known limitations and to boost the algorithm's performance. 

One of the supplementary features added is \textit{Inertia Weight} from PSO. Inertia Weight is a decreasing parameter brought to PSO for balancing local and global search. As illustrated in Figure \vref{fig:psoBeginning} and Figure \vref{fig:psoEnd}, tends the particles in PSO to explore more in early iterations, and becoming more organized and coordinated in the later iterations of the algorithm. In the initialization phase of SSO, will an an amount of the generated ants be declared ``crazy''. A so called \textit{Crazy Ant (CA)}, will work randomly, and not consider edge values when selecting nodes to be included in a route. The probability of an ant being declared crazy is given by a predefined start value, decreasing iteratively with the inertia weight (IW). %The IW value, as in PSO, is high in the early iterations, denoting a higher amount of CA, and decreases in pace with the IW. 
 %The probability that ant $a$ is declared crazy will never reach zero, so there always is a probability that $a$ is declared crazy.
Further, is the individual's awareness of the global best solution from PSO added. Each individual particle in PSO knows the best position achieved among all the particles so far. To implement this feature to SSO,  is the best ant's results, $ba_i$, retained after each iteration. If an edge is walked by $ba_i$, will the probability for the current ant to walk the same path, increase. The type CA and the awareness of the global best solution is implemented in order to compensate for the original ACO algorithm's weakness of frequently getting stuck at a local optima. %CA combined with the inertia weight is inspired by the way the inertia weight in PSO favors exploration in early iterations and exploitation in the later.

Finally, is the \textit{following} feature from BCO added. As explained in \vref{subsec:BCO}, is deciding which bee to follow in BCO considered to be a function of the quality of the food source to the recruiter. After the algorithm's first iteration will and amount, $n$, of the generated ants be initialized as ``uncommitted followers'', also referred to as Following Ants (FA). The FA's will follow the $n$ best ants from the previous generation unconditionally. The aim with this implementation is to boost the algorithm's performance, by rewarding the best ants route sets with more pheromone.

%What we hope to achieve with these features is overcoming the ACO limitation of getting stuck at a local optima, as well achieving better results concerning the Performance Criteria, introduced in Section \vref{sec:performanceCriteria}.

%%Artifacts:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item The ants have memory. It can remember whether or not it has visited a node in the creation of the route set.
%\item The ants have a notion of the global best ant. The ant will favor the edge chosen by the global best ant. (PSO)
%\item The ants can be ``crazy''. A crazy ant chooses next nodes at random given possible nodes, not considering the edge %values. This is to compensate for ACO getting stuck at local optima.
%\item An inertia weight is used. The inertia weight is used to calculate the number of crazy ants. At the beginning the number of crazy ants is larger (exploring). The inertia weight is decreased by each iteration, and therefore the number of crazy ants is decreased (exploiting). PSO.  \emph{\color{red} Check if inertia weight is mentioned in the PSO-section. If not write about it and refer to http://www.softcomputing.net/nabic11_7.pdf}
%\item After the first run, some ants are initialized as ``uncommitted followers''. They follow the $n$ best ants from the previous iteration without doubt. (BCO)
