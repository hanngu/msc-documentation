\section{Objective function}
\textbf{Reserach Question 2: }

Using Mandl, the constraints and evaluation criteria defined under, we will manage to answer research question number 2: Is it efficient to combine attributes from different swarm intelligence methods to optimize a transit network? This is because we facilitate the comparison with other algorithms results mentioned in the literature. 


\textbf{Initialization}
\begin{itemize}
\item The route size is predefined. The algorithm / routes shall not exceed the minimum or maximum limit of nodes.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
\item A passenger should be able to travel between any two nodes in the route network. In other words, it should be a connected graph. 
\item No cycles (or backtracks) in the graph is allowed.
\item To simplify the problem, there are exactly r routes in the route set.
\item The number of nodes in the routes .... 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Evaluation criteria}
These will be given higher pheromone
\begin{itemize}
\item Total travel time (should be as low as possible)
\item Number of transfers
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of direct travelers (should be as high as possible)
\item Travelers with one transfer
\item Travelers with two transfers
\end{itemize}
\item Number of unsatisfied customers (should be as low as possible)
\item The nodes with high demand should have higher priority.
\end{itemize}
