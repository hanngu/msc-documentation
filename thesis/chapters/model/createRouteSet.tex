\section{Creating the Route Set}
The node selecting phase stops if it exceeds $k$ nodes, as constraint \ref{itm:constraintRouteSize} specifies; the route size is predefined, so the routes shall not exceed the maximum limit of nodes. It also stops if it is ``stuck'', because it is should not be possible to select the same node twice, according to constraint \ref{itm:constraintCycles}; no cycles (or backtracks) in the graph is allowed. The ant then begins the next route exploring. The route exploring stops when it exceeds the maximum number of routes, as specified in constraint \ref{itm:constraintRouteSet}; there are exactly $r$ routes in the route set. The routes are then added to the ant's route set for evaluation.
