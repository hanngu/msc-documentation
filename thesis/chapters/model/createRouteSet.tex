\section{Creating the Route Set}
\label{sec:algoCreatingRouteSet}

When a next node is selected, ant $a$ adds the current node to the current route and declares the selected next node as current node. As constraint \vref{itm:constraintRouteSize} specifies, the route set is predefined, and a route should not exceed the maximum limit of nodes. If the current route reached its maximum number, $R_{max}$, of nodes by adding the old current node, the current route is added to the route set and a new route is initialized. As constraint \vref{itm:constraintRouteSetSize} specifies, the route set size is also predefined, and $a$ contains exactly one route set. If the route set has reached its maximum limit, $RS_{max}$, no new route will be created. If the maximum number of routes is reached, $a$ has finished its tour, the route set is added to the Neo4j database and $a$ is ready for evaluation.
