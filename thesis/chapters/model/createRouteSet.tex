\section{Creating the Route Set}
\label{sec:algoCreatingRouteSet}

When a node is selected as the next node, it is added to the route, and declared as the current node. If the current route has reached its maximum number, $R_{max}$, of nodes, Constraint \vref{itm:constraintRouteSize}, the current route is added to the route set and a new route is initialized. As Constraint \vref{itm:constraintRouteSetSize} specifies, the route set size is predefined, and if the route set has reached its maximum limit, $RS_{max}$, no new route will be created. If $RS_{max}$ is reached, $a$ has finished its tour, the route set is added to the Neo4j database and $a$ is ready for evaluation.
