The processes described in Sections \ref{sec:algoGeneratingSuperSwarm}-\ref{sec:evaporation} combined represents one iteration, and are all executed $i$ times. The ants are recreated each iteration, but the ants initialized as following ants acts as clones of the best ants from the previous generation. The edges, including the pheromone level, are carried over to the next generation, along with the data from the global best ant so far. The algorithm terminates when $i$ iterations is finished running.
