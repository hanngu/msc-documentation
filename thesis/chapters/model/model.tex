Here you will present the architecture or model that you have chosen and that is (or will be) implemented in your work. Note that putting algorithms in your report is not desirable but in certain cases these might be placed in the appendix. Code further be avoided in the report itself but may be delivered in the fashion requested by the supervisor or, in the case of masters delivery, submitted as additional documents. 

\textit{This is the main structure of what you built.
- Not at code level, but you can include pseudocode.
Explain the system in a way the reader understands it.
Include diagrams and the algorithms used.}
