Here you will present the architecture or model that you have chosen and that is (or will be) implemented in your work. Note that putting algorithms in your report is not desirable but in certain cases these might be placed in the appendix. Code further be avoided in the report itself but may be delivered in the fashion requested by the supervisor or, in the case of masters delivery, submitted as additional documents. 

\textit{This is the main structure of what you built.
- Not at code level, but you can include pseudocode.
Explain the system in a way the reader understands it.
Include diagrams and the algorithms used.}

The \textbf{Tour planning process} is a set of requests that needs to be assigned to a set of resources (e.g. vehicles that execute the transportation process). 
\begin{itemize}
\item Performing the assignment and sequencing tasks results in a tour for each vehicle.  
\item The step in a tour, which consists of traveling from one request to the next, is called a route.
\item The set of all vehicle tours form a tour plan, which is also denoted as the solution of the considered problem. 
\item The generation of a tour plan is connected to a specific aim, which is pursued. This aim is defined by the objective function, which assigns a specific objective function value to each solution. (This makes it possible to compare solutions according to their solution quality)
\item The goal is to find the optimal solution (e.g. the one with the best objective function among all feasible solutions) 
\end{itemize}
