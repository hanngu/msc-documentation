 \citet{website:atb} is responsible for planning the public transport throughout Sør-Trøndelag County, and bus services comprise the major component of the public transportation system. From a meeting with AtB we learned that the current solution of AtB consists of an experience based route network, where no common methodology is used, and where all bus route networks and schedules are designed manually. As a result, the efficiency of the resulting networks is highly dependent of the designers expedience and his / hers knowledge of existing resource constraints and transportation demands.

 Satisfying all customer needs, and keeping all operator costs in check, is really difficult to achieve \citep{kechagiopoulos14}. Operator costs mainly refer to the total number of buses, total bus running distance and the total operation hours. A minimum trip time, amount of transitions, and a not too crowded bus (customers can tolerate standing in 15 minutes ) are among the most important factors that determine the passengers choice of public transit, AtB experiences.  
 \textit{The main concern of bus companies is maximizing its profits, while the main concern of the government is to fulfill all needs of traveling in public} \citep{kechagiopoulos14}. The manual attempts to provide an acceptable solution this problem are not able to solve these large network problems efficiently \citep{kechagiopoulos14}.
