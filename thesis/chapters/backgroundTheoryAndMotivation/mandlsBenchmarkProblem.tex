In the current research on the VRPs, some benchmark data are available for researchers, these can be seen in some websites such as TSLIPB and OR-Library. However, for the UTNDPm Mandls network seems the only benchmark instanse popularity used by researchers. 

In order to demonstrate the efficiency and the effectiveness of our algorithm... the Swiss road network introduced by Mandl is used. This road network has been already used as a benchmark problem by many researchers in the literature. \citep{kechagiopoulos14}

This road network is a real Swiss road network which comprised of 15 nodes and 21 connections between them. This road network has been widely examined by many optimization approaches such as \citep{kechagiopoulos14}, \citep{fan09}, \citep{nikolic14}.
