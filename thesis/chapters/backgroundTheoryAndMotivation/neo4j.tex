\subsection{Neo4J}

Neo4J is a native graph database, and is a success way to store a transport graph [Reference]. It is known for extremely fast traversals of relationships. Neo4J can be easily constructed to a transit network. It is fast finding shortest path (by Dijkstra's algorithm), and it is easy to change the database via the REST API. 

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Native graph database. 
%\item Property graph. 
%\item Made for real time queries. 
%\item Really fast traversals of relations.
%\item Neo4J has an API that supports traversing - finding shortest path - can weight edges, nodes -
%\end{itemize}
%//en korteste vei mellom n og m men max lengde 3
%match p = shortestPath ( (n) - [*...3]--(m)) return p
%(Vekte kanter: Neo44J har et API som st√∏tter traversering, Dijkstras er innebyd ++ som lar deg vekte kanter - hva er raskeste vei ++)

%Neo4J can be used to evaluate routes after the ants have created route sets.
