The value of $CA$ is sat to 5\% based on the results shown in Table \vref{table:pm2} in Appendix \ref{appendixC}. The reader recalls from Section \vref{sec:algoInitialization} that this means that there is a 5\% probability that an ant is declared ``crazy'' and thus makes completely random decisions. The results in Table \vref{table:pm2} shows that the algorithm benefits from the fact that some ants are declared crazy, but also that if the probability is greater than 25\%, both the average $ATT$ and the average $TOTFIT$ results become worse. This is not very surprising, because if half of the colony or more acts randomly, the algorithm looses some of the performing boosting features from ACO, such as favoring edges frequently walked by other ants. Like for $s$ below 50, a value of $CA$ above 50\% sometimes produces ant colonies were no ants satisfy the initial Constraint \ref{itm:criteriaConnectedGraph} described in Section \vref{sec:algoConstraints}. This is again not very surprising, because when such a large part of the colony acts randomly, several (and sometimes all) of these ants will create route sets that do not include every node in the network. The probability of creating a route set that does not contain all nodes are decreased in ``normal'' ants by the fact that they favor nodes they have not yet visited in the given route set.
