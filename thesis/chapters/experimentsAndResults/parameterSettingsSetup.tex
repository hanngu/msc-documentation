\subsection{Stage 1 - Parameter Settings}

Because there is no way of defining the most effective values of the parameters, a selection of some of the best parameters is selected. For achieving this goal, several values for each parameter are tested while the other are hold constant. For determining these parameters each one of the instance will run 10 times while the others are held constant, and the ones which are selected is the ones that produce best computational results concerning the quality of the solution (objective function values) needed to achieve this result. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Ants colony size
\item Total iterations
\item Pheromone increase value on edge when selecting next node.
\item Pheromone increase value on all edges in best route set each iteration.
\item Pheromone decrease value.
\end{enumerate}
