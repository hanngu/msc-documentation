\emph{\color{red}TODO:} The proposed SuperSwarm algorithm is coded in Java programming language.  Concerning experience in programing languages, we have best experienced with Python and Java. Because Java is known for its fast calculations, we believe this will be positive \emph{\color{red} mer her, mulig vi trenger noen referanser.}. Neo4j is implemented in Java, and the Java built-in methods (Dijkstra's and A*) has a lot of documentation. We believed this would be less time consuming  concerning using time creating our own methods for implementation.
