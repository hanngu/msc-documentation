\section{Development Environment}

\emph{\color{red}TODO:} 
The proposed SuperSwarm Optimization algorithm is coded in Java programming language.  
%Concerning experience in programing languages, we have best experienced with Python and Java. Because Java is known for its fast calculations, we believe this will be positive \emph{\color{red} mer her, mulig vi trenger noen referanser.}. Neo4j is implemented in Java, and the Java built-in methods (Dijkstra's and A*) has a lot of documentation. We believed this would be less time consuming concerning using time creating our own methods for implementation. 

When it comes to comparing Java to C++, C++ is faster because in Java programs all the classes have to be compiled first, but this difference becomes insignificant in case of larger applications.
