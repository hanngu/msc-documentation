\section{Development Environment}

The proposed SuperSwarm Optimization algorithm is programmed in the Java programming language. Java is chosen because we are most familiar with that language and therefor believe the development time is reduced. Further, Java is one of the most used programming languages world wide, and the possibility of further development by other contributors will be enhanced using Java. An additional benefit is that Neo4j offers a rich set of integration possibilities for Java and that these possibilities are well documented. Nevertheless, compared to languages like C++, Java is often considered slow and memory-intensive \citep{alnaser12}. However, \citet{sestoft10} states that managed languages like Java are easier and safer to use than traditional languages like C++. \citet{sestoft10} concludes, based on his conducted experiments, that ``there is no obvious relation between the execution speeds of different software platforms, even for the very simple programs studied here: the C, C\# and Java platforms are variously fastest and slowest''.

An embedded version of the Neo4j database is used in order to represent the network including nodes, edges and the created routes. Because we have many reads and writes to the database, an embedded version is preferred because it has lower latency.  

In order to handle project dependencies, such as Neo4j, and configuration details, Apache Maven[1] is used. Maven is a tool that can be used for building and managing any Java-based project. 

%The tests are executed on a Windows machine,  XX with a xx processor running at xxx.
The tests are all performed on Amazon EC2 instances with Ubuntu operating system. The tests ran on C4 instances, which are the latest generation of Compute-optimized instances that Amazon provides. C4 contains high frequency Intel Xeon E5-2666 v3 (Haswell) processors optimized specifically for EC2. The instances used had either 4 or 8 virtual processors, and respectively either 7.5 or 15 GiB memory. Because of the large number of parameter values tested, Shell scripts were made in order to effectively execute the program with different values.
