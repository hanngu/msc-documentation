\subsection{Stage 2 - Performance Comparison}

\subsubsection{Algorithm Parameters}
\emph{\color{red} After running test case 1 (TODO), finding the optimal algorithm parameters, these are the final results :}

\begin{itemize}
\item Ants colony size: 100.
\item Transfer penalty: 5 min
\item Routes in the route set: 4
\item Maximum number of nodes in routes: 8
\item Total iterations: 100
\item Minimum number of nodes in route set: 3
\item Maximum route length at the initialization stage: \emph{\color{red} TODO}
\item Pheromone increase value on edge when selecting next node: 0.1
\item Pheromone increase value on all edges in best route set each iteration: 0.5
\item Pheromone decrease value: 1.0
\end{itemize}
