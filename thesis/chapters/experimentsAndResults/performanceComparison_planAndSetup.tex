\subsection{Performance Comparison}
\label{subsec:performanceComparison_setup}
We will in this stage test the system's performance, comparing it with the respective results, concerning the performance criteria. The algorithm will be tested with different number of routes. In all the approaches the algorithm will be compared to, is the transfer penalty of 5 min applied to each route for each required transfer, and the same transfer penalty will also be used by the proposed SSO algorithm.

To demonstrate reliability, will there be carried out runs per experiment, recording the average (AVG), best (MAX) and worst (MIN) ant. The values for each parameter used in this experiment are all found in the parameter setting experiments, Table \vref{table:parameterSettings2}.




%Under er det beskrevet når vi skal velge ut beste og dårligste maur, stemmer disse nå? Hvis de gjør det, kan de kanskje gjøres om til en formel som i parameter settings.


%\emph{\color{blue} TODO: Because of reasons }we believe that ATT and $d_0$ is the most important parameters for determining best and worst ants, therefore, the selection of the MAX and MIN ant will be selected based on these parameters. 

%\subsubsection{Selecting MAX ant}
%\begin{algorithm}[H]
%$Ant_{i}$ = ant with highest $d_0$\;
%$Ant_{j}$ = ant with lowest ATT\;
%\eIf{($Ant_{i}$ = $Ant_{j}$)}{
%	Select this ant
%}
%{
%	$d_0(\%)$ = $(d_0(lowest) / d_0(highest))*100$\;
%	$ATT(\%)$ = $(ATT(lowest) / ATT(highest))*100$\;
%	\eIf{ ($ d_0(\%) $ $ \geq $ ATT(\%)) }{
%		select $Ant_{j}$
%	}
%	{
%		select $Ant_{i}$
%	}
%}
% \caption{Selecting MAX Ant}
%\end{algorithm}


%The comparison is done by calculating the percentage of the difference between the highest and lowest $d_0$ and $ATT$ values. If the difference in the two $d_0$'s is higher than the difference in the two $ATT$'s, the ant with lowest ATT is selected, or else the ant with the highest $d_0$ is selected. As mentioned, a low as possible $ATT$ value and a high as possible $d_0$ value is what we want to achieve.

%\subsubsection{Selecting MIN ant}
%\begin{algorithm}[H]
%$Ant_{i}$ = ant with lowest $d_0$\;
%$Ant_{j}$ = ant with highest ATT\;
%eIf{($Ant_{i}$ = $Ant_{j}$)}{
%	Select this ant
%}
%{
%	$d_0(\%)$ = $(d_0(lowest) / d_0(highest))*100$\;
%	$ATT(\%)$ = $(ATT(lowest) / ATT(highest))*100$\;
%	\eIf{ ($ d_0(\%) $ $ \leq $ ATT(\%)) }{
%		select $Ant_{j}$
%	}
%	{
%		select $Ant_{i}$
%	}
%}
% \caption{Selecting MIN Ant}
%\end{algorithm}

%The comparison is also done by calculating the percentage of the difference between the highest and lowest $d_0$ and $ATT$ values. If the difference in the two $ATT$'s is higher than the difference in the two $d_0$'s, the the ant with highest ATT is selected, or else the ant with the lowest $d_0$ is selected. A high $ATT$ and a low $d_0$ is not considered good.
