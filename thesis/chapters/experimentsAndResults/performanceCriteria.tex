\section{Performance Criteria}
\label{sec:performanceCriteria}

The criteria used in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, which have been adopted by many researchers in the literature \emph{color{red}(Referanser)}.

To measure the efficiency and the quality of our algorithm, the experimental results generated by the proposed algorithm(s) will be compared with the respective results (Mandl, Mumford etc), based on the evaluation criteria in section 3.1.2: 
%These measures were adopted from \citet{kechagiopoulos14}.

\begin{itemize}
\item $d_0 (\%)$ - the percentage of demand satisfied without any transfers, \emph{\color{red}and is calculated as followed:}
\item $d_1 (\%)$ - percentage of total transfer demands where the number of transfers are 1, \emph{\color{red}and is calculated as followed:}
\item $d_2 (\%)$ - percentage of total transfer demands where the number of transfers are 2, \emph{\color{red}and is calculated as followed:}
\item $d_{unsat}$ (\%) - the percentage of demand unsatisfied, which should be equal to zero, \emph{\color{red}and is calculated as followed:}
\item $ATT$  - the average travel times in minutes per transit user (mpu). This incorporates transfer waiting times, \emph{\color{red}and is calculated as followed:}
\end{itemize}
