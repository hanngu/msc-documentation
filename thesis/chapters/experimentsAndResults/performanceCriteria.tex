\section{Performance Criteria}


The criteria used in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, which have been adopted by many researchers in the literature (Referanser).

To measure the efficiency and the quality of our algorithm, the experimental results generated by the proposed algorithm(s) will be compared with the respective results (Mandl, Mumford etc), based on the evaluation criteria in section 3.1.2: 
These measures were adopted from \citet{kechagiopoulos14}.

\begin{itemize}
\item $d_0 (\%)$ - the percentage of demand satisfied without any transfers, which should be as high as possible
\item $d_1 (\%)$ - percentage of total transfer demands where the number of transfers are 1
\item $d_2 (\%)$ - percentage of total transfer demands where the number of transfers are 2
\item $d_{unsat}$ (\%) - the percentage of demand unsatisfied, which should be equal to zero.
\item $ATT$  - the average travel times in minutes per transit user, which should be as low as possible
\end{itemize}

To demonstrate reliability, we will carry out 10 replicate runs per experiment, recording the average(AVG), maximum(MAX) and minimum(MIN) running time in seconds.

\emph{\color{red} Because of reasons }we believe that ATT and $d_0$ is the most important parameters, therefore the selection of MAX and MIN will be compared on these parameters.

\subsection{Selecting MAX Ant}

\begin{algorithm}[H]
$Ant_{i}$ = ant with highest $d_0$\;
$Ant_{j}$ = ant with lowest ATT\;
\eIf{($Ant_{i}$ = $Ant_{j}$)}{
	Select this ant
}
{
	$d_0(\%)$ = $(d_0(lowest) / d_0(highest))*100$\;
	$ATT(\%)$ = $(ATT(lowest) / ATT(highest))*100$\;
	\eIf{ ($ d_0(\%) $ $ \geq $ ATT(\%)) }{
		select $Ant_{j}$
	}
	{
		select $Ant_{i}$
	}
}

\subsection{Selecting MIN Ant}
\begin{algorithm}[H]
$Ant_{i}$ = ant with lowest $d_0$\;
$Ant_{j}$ = ant with highest ATT\;
\eIf{($Ant_{i}$ = $Ant_{j}$)}{
	Select this ant
}
{
	$d_0(\%)$ = $(d_0(lowest) / d_0(highest))*100$\;
	$ATT(\%)$ = $(ATT(lowest) / ATT(highest))*100$\;
	\eIf{ ($ d_0(\%) $ $ \leq $ ATT(\%)) }{
		select $Ant_{j}$
	}
	{
		select $Ant_{i}$
	}
}
