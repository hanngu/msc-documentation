\section{Performance Criteria}
\label{sec:performanceCriteria}
To measure the performance of our algorithm, the experimental results generated by the proposed algorithm will be compared with the respective results from \citep{mandl79}, \citep{kechagiopoulos14}, \citep{nikolic14}, and \citep{fan09}. The criteria used to evaluate the performance have been adopted by many researchers in the literature, and are the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item $d_0 (\%)$ - the percentage of demand satisfied without any transfers. $d_0$ is calculated as follows:
$$ d_0 = \frac{DirectTravelers}{TotalTravelers}*100$$
\item $d_1 (\%)$ - percentage of total transfer demands where the number of transfers are 1. $d_1$ is calculated as follows:
$$ d_1 = \frac{OneTransferTravelers}{TotalTravelers}*100$$
\item $d_2 (\%)$ - percentage of total transfer demands where the number of transfers are 2. $d_2$ is calculated as follows:
$$ d_2 = \frac{TwoTransfersTravelers}{TotalTravelers}*100$$
\item $d_{unsat}$ (\%) - the percentage of unsatisfied travelers. An unsatisfied traveler is described as a traveler with 3 or more transfers and $d_{unsat}$ is calculated as follows:
$$ d_{unsat} = 100 - d_0 - d_1 - d_2$$
\item $ATT$  - the average travel time in minutes per transit user (mpu). The travel times incorporates a transfer penalty, which is sat to be 5 minutes per transfer for comparison reasons. $ATT$ is calculated as follows:
$$ATT = \frac{\sum\limits^{p}_{p=1}TT}{p_{size}}$$
where $p_{size}$ is the number of passengers and $TT$ is the travel time used by passenger $p$. 
\end{itemize}
