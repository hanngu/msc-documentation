\section{Experimental Plan}
\label{sec:expPlan}
The algorithm will be tested on the Swiss road network introduced by Mandl,\citep{mandl79}, and details about the input data is found in Appendix \vref{sec:inputData}. As mentioned has this network already been used as a benchmark problem by many researchers in the literature\citep{kechagiopoulos14}, \citep{mandl79}, \citep{fan09}. In order to evaluate the algorithm's performance, some performance criteria is used, presented in Section \vref{sec:performanceCriteria}. The results will also be compared to results, regarding the performance criteria, published by researchers.

The experimental setup and results, Section \vref{sec:expSetup}, and \vref{sec:expResults} respectively, are divided in to three parts. 

The first part will is the parameter settings experiment. Metaheuristics, like ACO, requires good initial parameters to solve concrete problems optimally. In order to study the effect of the variation of the parameters, will we conduct a series of experiments to find the most optimal algorithm parameters concerning the performance criteria. As mentioned in Section \vref{sec:relatedWork}, refers several authors to their parameter settings experiments as a product of ``trial and error'', without presenting the parameter values tested. For contributing to the field and providing a starting point for future research, will this thesis include a complete review of the conducted experiment. The selected values for the parameters will be used as the default values for the second part of the experiments, which is the performance comparison experiments.

In this part, will four different instances be studied, each having different number of routes, in order for our experimental results to be straight comparable with the results published by other researchers. More precisely will we examine four different cases with four, six, seven and eight routes in the route set, respectively. For each case, the best route will be presented and the respective experimental results are compared with the results published by [refs]. In all these approaches a transfer penalty of 5 min is applied to each route for each required transfer, and the same transfer penalty will also be used by the proposed SSO algorithm. 

\emph{\color{blue} TODO: } The final part is the scalability experiments, where we will test the algorithm on larger networks. Since Mandl's network only consist of 15 nodes and 21 edges, will the input data for this experiment be other networks, and these are retrieved from \citet{mumford13}. %The programs are rarely informative if they are designed to run on a single example - Therefore we will test algorithm on other, larger, networks, to check whether it is general and not just optimized for Mandl. (Mumford)

The parameter experiments will the experiment help establish Research Question \vref{itm:2a}, by studying the effect of the variation on the additional PSO and BCO parameters. This RQ is concerned whether it is efficient to combine attributes from different swarm-intelligence method in order to improve the basic ACO. When the optimal parameters are determined, will the comparison studies determine if the proposed algorithm's computational results performs better than the result published in the literature, and with this establish Research Question \vref{itm:2b1}. The mandl network used for comparison is a relatively small network, and will not be a comparable basis considering Research Question \vref{itm:2b}, which is concerned about if it is possible to apply the proposed algorithm to transit networks in real cities. The majority of real cities has a lot larger transit network, and the scalability experiments will therefore determine if the algorithm supports input from larger networks, and with this determine Research Question \vref{itm:2b}.



%The exact shape of any normal curve is totally determined by its mean and standard deviation. %Therefore, if we know the mean and standard deviation of a statistic, we can find the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the statistic

%For most of the parameters the different parameter values will only be tested a limited number of times, and a statistical analysis will not be provided. This is because a complete analysis of the parameter settings is beyond the scope of this thesis, and the results of the tests without a statistical analysis should only be considered as indicative. The parameters directly linked to features of PSO and BCO will be tested more thoroughly and a statistical analysis will be provided, because this will help us establish Research Question \vref{itm:2a}.
