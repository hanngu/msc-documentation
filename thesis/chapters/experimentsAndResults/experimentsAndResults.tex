This chapter will in detail describe the experiments conducted. 

%Trying and failing is a major part of research. However, to have a chance of success you need a plan driving the experimental research, just as you need a plan for your literature search. Further, plans are made to be revised and this revision ensures that any further decisions made are in line with the work already completed.  
 
%Such questions should be connected to your research questions so that in the evaluation of your results you can discuss the results wrt to the research questions.

%CCohen: The purpose of evaluation at this stage is to convince the researcher and the community that studies of a program - independent of their results - are well-designed and complete. Experiment schema's would offer researchers a shorthand to describe their studies.
