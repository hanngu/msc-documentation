%Trying and failing is a major part of research. However, to have a chance of success you need a plan driving the experimental research, just as you need a plan for your literature search. Further, plans are made to be revised and this revision ensures that any further decisions made are in line with the work already completed.  

%The plan should include what experiments or series of experiments are planned and what question the individual or set of experiments aim to answer. Such questions should be connected to your research questions so that in the evaluation of your results you can discuss the results wrt to the research questions.

%CCohen: The purpose of evaluation at this stage is to convince the researcher and the community that studies of a program - independent of their results - are well-designed and complete. Experiment schema's would offer researchers a shorthand to describe their studies.
