In this chapter will the experiments of the proposed algorithm to the UTRP be presented. Section \vref{sec:expPlan} will present what series of experiments are planned, criteria for good performance, and the aim with the experiments. Section xx describes the environment used in order to develop the proposed algorithm, in addition to the environment used to run the experiments. Section \vref{sec:expSetup} goes into detail about different values used to perform the experiments and Section \vref{sec:expResults} will present the computational results. 
%This chapter will in detail describe the experiments conducted. 

%Trying and failing is a major part of research. However, to have a chance of success you need a plan driving the experimental research, just as you need a plan for your literature search. Further, plans are made to be revised and this revision ensures that any further decisions made are in line with the work already completed.  
 
%Such questions should be connected to your research questions so that in the evaluation of your results you can discuss the results wrt to the research questions.

%CCohen: The purpose of evaluation at this stage is to convince the researcher and the community that studies of a program - independent of their results - are well-designed and complete. Experiment schema's would offer researchers a shorthand to describe their studies.
