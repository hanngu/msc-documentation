\section{Experimental Setup}

The experimental setup should include all data - parameters etc, that would allow a person to repeat your experiments. 
 
\subsection{Stage 1 - Parameter Settings}
\label{subsec:parameterSettings_setup}

Because there is no way of defining the most effective values of the parameters, a selection of some of the best parameters is selected. For achieving this goal, several values for each parameter are tested while the other are hold constant. For determining these parameters each one of the instance will run 10 times while the others are held constant, and the ones which are selected is the ones that produce best computational results concerning the quality of the solution (objective function values) needed to achieve this result. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Ants colony size}, $s$.
\item \textbf{Total iterations}, $i$, and is the maximum number of iterations will be chosen as the termination criteria - and will be tested from when it converges. 
\item The \textbf{evaporation constant, $p_{e}$}, to determine how much pheromone to be removed at each edge at each iteration. 
\item The \textbf{pheromone constant, $p_{v}$}, to determine how much pheromone to be added to each edge as it is visited by ants. 
\item The \textbf{pheromone constant, $p_{b}$}, to determine how much extra pheromone to be granted to edges included in the \textit{n} best route sets.
\item The percentage of complete route sets to be granted extra pheromone, the best route sets, $BR$.
\item \textbf{Inertia Weight}, $IW$.
\item Percentage of \textbf{ants to be followed}, $FA$.
\item Percentage of \textbf{crazy ants}, $CA$.
\end{enumerate}
