\section{Experimental Setup}

The experimental setup should include all data - parameters etc, that would allow a person to repeat your experiments. 
 
\subsection{Structured Literature Review}

\begin{itemize}
\item The points, $P$ and $C$, and the following research questions can be found in appendix \ref{appendixA}, section A.3. 
\item The key terms and the complete search term can be found in appendix \ref{appendixA}, section A.1 and section A.2, respectively.
\item The inclusion criteria can be found in appendix \ref{appendixA}, section A.4.
\item The quality criteria can be found in appendix \ref{appendixA}, section A.5. Each point will be given a score, where 1 point means relevant, $\frac{1}{2}$ point means partly relevant and 0 points means not relevant. For retrieving the most relevant papers based on the content and not just the quality of the paper, quality criteria 1(a) and 1(b) will be multiplied with 3.
\item The selection of the final literature will be based on the quality criteria scores, and the literature given a score $\geq{1.5}$ above average will be selected.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Stage 1 - Parameter Settings}

Because there is no way of defining the most effective values of the parameters, a selection of some of the best parameters is selected. For achieving this goal, several values for each parameter are tested while the other are hold constant. For determining these parameters each one of the instance will run 10 times while the others are held constant, and the ones which are selected is the ones that produce best computational results concerning the quality of the solution (objective function values) needed to achieve this result. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Ants colony size
\item Total iterations

The total iterations will be tested from when it converges. Start: 200

\item Pheromone increase value on edge when selecting next node:

$$ \tau_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{m} \Delta \tau^k_{ij}$$

where $ \Delta \tau^k_{ij} $ is the amount of pheromone laid on route (i,j) by the $k^{th}$ ant and is given by

$$
\Delta \tau^k_{ij} = \Bigg\{
\begin{array}{l l}
\underline{Q} &  \quad \text{if route (i,j) be traversed by}\\
f_k, &  \quad \text{the $k^{th}$ ant (at the current cycle) , }\\
0 &  \quad \text{otherwise}
\end{array}
$$

Q: 0.9
\newline
$f_k$: the travel time on the edge.

\item Pheromone increase value on all edges in best route set each iteration.
\item Pheromone decrease value. remove 10\%

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Stage 2 - Performance Comparison}

\subsubsection{Algorithm Parameters}
\emph{\color{red} After running test case 1 (TODO), finding the optimal algorithm parameters, these are the final results :}

\begin{itemize}
\item Ants colony size: 100.
\item Transfer penalty: 5 min - This is the value used in the other papers.
\item Routes in the route set: 4
\item Maximum number of nodes in routes: 8
\item Total iterations: 100
\item Minimum number of nodes in routes: 3. To avoid having less than 3 nodes in the route, it is not possible to select an edge that has a connected edge with only one edge connected to it.
\item Maximum route length in minutes: \emph{\color{red} TODO}
\item Pheromone increase value on edge when selecting next node: 0.1
\item Pheromone increase value on all edges in best route set each iteration: 0.5
\item Pheromone decrease value: 1.0
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Stage 3 -  Scalability Experiments}
