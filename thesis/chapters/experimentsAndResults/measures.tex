\section{Measures / Objective function values}
%Comparison studies: Select on ore more \textit{measures} of a programs performance. Then both the program and a standard solve a set of problems. And finally the solutions are compared on the measures. 
The experimental results generated by the proposed algorithm(s) will be compared with the respective results (Mandl, Mumford etc), based on the evaluation criteria in section 3.1.2: 
These measures were adopted from \citet{kechagiopoulos14}.

\begin{itemize}
\item $d_0 (\%)$ - percentage of total transfer demands satisfied directly
\item $d_1 (\%)$ - percentage of total transfer demands where the number of transfers are 1
\item $d_2 (\%)$ - percentage of total transfer demands where the number of transfers are 2
\item $d_unsat$ (\%) - number of unsatisfied travelers (more than 2 transfers)
\item $ATT$  - average travel time between each node couples, including the time penalties for possible transfers, experienced by each passenger of the transit network.
\end{itemize}
