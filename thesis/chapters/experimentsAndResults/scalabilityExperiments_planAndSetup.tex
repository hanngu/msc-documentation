\subsection{Scalability Experiments}
\label{subsec:scalabilityExperiments_setup}

The Mumford network\citep{mumford13} is used as the input data for the scalability experiments. \citet{mumford13} generated instances, consisting of transport networks with roads and bus stops. Coordinates, travel times and demand values are all provided. Table \vref{table:dataSet_mumford} defines the properties of the test data. Constraint \vref{itm:constraintRouteSize} specifies that the route size is predefined, and that the routes shall not exceed the minimum or maximum limit of nodes. $Min(n)$ and $Max(n)$ is the minimum and maximum number of nodes in the route, respectively. The route set size, $RS_{size}$, is also predefined, as mentioned in Constraint \vref{itm:constraintRouteSetSize}.  %Coordinates where generated within boundaries to maintain a similar density of points, and travel times where generated based on Euclidean distances. A general level of demand was randomly generated by the software.
