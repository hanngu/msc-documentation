%Results should be clearly displayed and should provide a suitable representation of your results for the points you wish to make. Graphs should be labeled in a legible font and if more than one result is displayed on the same graph then these should be clearly marked.   Please choose carefully rather than presenting every results. Too much information is hard to read and often hides the key information you wish to present. Make use of statistical methods when presenting results, where possible to strengthen the results.  Further, the format of the presentation of results should be chosen based on what issues in the results you wish to highlight. You may wish to present a subset in the experimental section and provide additional results in the appendix.

\textbf{Selecting Final Parameters}
\newline

As one can observe in Appendix \ref{appendixC}, Table \vref{table:pm1} and Table \vref{table:pm2}, the computed Confidence Interval does not become remarkably better after running the algorithm 50 times compared to 30. This makes it reasonable to conclude that the results regarding the parameters that were ran 30 times are valid.
\newline
%Because our confidence coefficient is sat to correspond to 95\%, we are able to say that we are 95\% confident that the true population parameter is between the lower and upper calculated values.

As one can observe in Table \vref{table:pm1}, increasing parameters $s$ and $i$ both decreased the average $TOTFIT$ value, which is equivalent to a better average solution. The selected value for both parameters should therefore be $125$ based on the average produced $TOTFIT$. One aspect not considered in the initial parameter setting experiment is that the size of $s$ and $i$ affects each other. A colony of 50 ants with 100 iterations would produce close to similar results to 100 ants with 50 iterations, because the total number of ants traversing the network will be the same. The most optimal would be to observe the results when increasing the value of both these parameters. However, an increase in the swarm size or number of iterations both clearly affect the computational cost of the proposed algorithm. The average runtime of each run, with each candidate value, is presented in Figure \ref{fig:svsiruntime}. As one can see, there is a difference in the running time with a colony size of 125 versus 125 iterations. Between 100 and 125 ants the running time increases with 393 seconds, while between 100 and 125 iterations the running time increases with about 140 seconds. \emph{\color{blue}TODO: why is that?} Because the algorithm is going to be run an excessive amount of times when testing performance, and increasing both of these parameter values will result in an enormous runtime. As seen in \ref{table:pm1}, increasing the number of iterations increase the $TOTFIT$ value more than increasing the $S$ value. Due to this, the selected value of parameter $s$ is sat to \textit{50} and $i$ is sat to \textit{125}.

It is worth mentioning that values below 50 of parameter $s$, sometimes produce ant colonies were no ants satisfies the initial Constraint \ref{itm:criteriaConnectedGraph} described in Section \vref{sec:algoConstraints}. When $s$ is 10, this occurs on average 14.5\% of the iterations. If no ant satisfy the initial constraint, no ant is either evaluated, and their results will be invalid.

Observing the produced results of parameter $E$ in Table \vref{table:pm1}, evaporating 25\% of the pheromone each iteration gave the best average total fitness. The worst results were achieved when $E$ is 10\%. Evaporating only a small percentage of the pheromone may result in ants getting stuck at local optima, due to the fact that routes found in the early iterations will contain significantly more pheromone than newly discovered routes. As one can observe, the best produced results is achieved by a candidate value is 25\%, closely followed by 50\%. The algorithm seems to benefit from the fact that a noticeable amount of pheromone evaporates each iteration, but as one can observe removing 90\% at each iteration seems to be to much. Evaporation is important because it ensures that the pheromone level on routes explored in early iterations, but later discarded in favor of others, decreases. By stating $E$ as a percentage we ensure that an equivalent amount of pheromone is removed from the each edge, independent of whether the pheromone level is big or small. As stated in Section \vref{subsec:parameterSettings_setup}, the edge selection phase is influenced by the ratio of the edge's pheromone level and the summed pheromone level of all possible edges. By removing a percentage of pheromone, the ratios will be the same at the end of iteration $i$ and at the beginning of $i+1$, but will be different at the end of iteration $i+1$ as the ants from that iteration is finished traversing the network. 
\newline

The value of $CA$ is sat to 25\% based on the results shown in Table \ref{table:pm2}, meaning there is a 25\% probability in the beginning that an ant is declared ``crazy'' and thus makes completely random decisions. $CA$ will decrease at each iteration based on the Inertia Weight, as described in \emph{\color{blue} Skrive inn section når hvordan sannsynligheten for at en ant er crazy regnes ut er skrevet riktig sted}. The results in Table \vref{table:pm2} shows that the algorithm benefits from the fact that some ants are declared crazy. As stated in Section \vref{section:methodDescription}, we believe that if some ants are declared crazy, the probability of getting stuck at a local optima decreases. However, if the probability is greater than 25\%, the average $TOTFIT$ results worsen. Not surprisingly, is this because half or more of the colony acts completely random, and the algorithm looses some of the performing boosting features from ACO, such as favoring edges frequently walked by other ants. 
\newline

The amount of $AF$ determines the amount of Following Ants ($FA$) in the next iteration, and the $FA$ follow the same path as the best ants' paths unconditionally. Observing the results obtained in Table \vref{table:pm2}, the $TOTFIT$ value deteriorates when the amount of $AF$ becomes greater than 25\%. When the amount of $FA$ becomes too great, a relatively large number of normal ants will not be able to explore new (possibly better) routes in the next iterations, and the algorithm may not be able to escape from a local optima. But as one also can see,  increasing the value computes better results than 0\%. Rewarding some good route sets seems to boost the algorithms performance, and 5\% is selected as the final parameter for $AF$. 

The value of $p_b$ is strongly dependent on the value of $AF$, because the more following ants, the more pheromone added to each edge in the best route sets. Because of this $p_b$ is, as mentioned in Section \vref{subsec:parameterSettings_setup}, tested with the selected value of $AF$. As one can observe in Table \vref{table:pm2}, the $TOTFIT$ becomes better when when $p_b$ increases, and thus the edges in the best routes are granted more pheromone. However it seems that when $p_b$ becomes greater than 0.9, the $TOTFIT$ value worsen. This may be because a value above 0.9 results in over appreciating the edges in the best route set, and thus increasing the probability of the ants getting stuck at a local optima. \emph{\color{blue} Kanskje vi skal skrive noe om at: Gitt både AF og pb ser vi at det mest lønnsomme er å gi få following ants en gangs stor boost}
