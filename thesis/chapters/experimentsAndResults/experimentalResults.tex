\section{Experimental Results}

Results should be clearly displayed and should provide a suitable representation of your results for the points you wish to make. Graphs should be labeled in a legible font and if more than one result is displayed on the same graph then these should be clearly marked.   Please choose carefully rather than presenting every results. Too much information is hard to read and often hides the key information you wish to present. Make use of statistical methods when presenting results, where possible to strengthen the results.  Further, the format of the presentation of results should be chosen based on what issues in the results you wish to highlight. You may wish to present a subset in the experimental section and provide additional results in the appendix.

\subsection{Structured Literature Review}
After the inclusion criteria filtering, we had 42 sources to related literature, including scientific papers and master theses. 

When selecting the final literature we decided to do this solely based on the quality criteria scores. The average score of the read literature was 13.01 $\approx$ 13. We decided that literature given a score $\geq{1.5}$ above average were selected. After this sorting we ended up with 14 final literature. These 12 literature are going to create the foundation of our thesis. Table \ref{table:finalliterature} on page \pageref{table:finalliterature} shows the selected literature.
